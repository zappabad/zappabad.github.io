## Common Terms

### Value

Value is one of those common terms to be "misused." By that I mean that there is no cohesive commonly used single definition of value, which means when somebody says value you don't know if they mean what you think they do and then it just becomes hard to talk about that very fundamental aspect of FAB.

Because of this, I'll try to give a singular definition of value, along with examples of what it is and isn't, as to help build a proper easy-to-understand so that people can refer to the same thing when they say value.

**Definition 1:** Value is a number associated with the byproduct of an interaction within the game as it relates to an amount of damage threatened or prevented.

So, in order to produce value, you **must** do an interaction that either threatens damage or prevents damage. The most common way to do so is by using cards in order to block or attack.

**Example A:** When you block with a card for 3, you produced 3 "points of value," or, more compactly, you produced 3 value. Another way of seeing this interaction is that the card was used for 3 value.

Most people say that a card is worth 3 value. But how can that be the case when there are cards that attack for 10? How is that even close to 3?

**Example B:** When you attack with a Raging Onslaught Red for 7 by pitching a Blue card, you make 3 resources out of your Blue, which was then used by another card (the Raging Onslaught) and your action point in order to produce 7 value.

One way to look at it is that Raging Onslaught attacks for 7 BECAUSE of the fact that it is worth 3 by itself. Then, each resource on every card's cost should be calculated by itself as being 1 value per resource. This means that Raging Onslaught produces 3 value by itself, and your blue produced 3 value (this is a shortcut, as it generated resources which then got converted at a 1-to-1 ratio to the power of Raging Onslaught).

Well, but that only get's us to 6. Now you got to remember that you are using another more "invisible" resource when you play out a Raging Onslaught: your Action Point, which is worth 1.

Finally coming back to example **B,** Raging Onslaught, the card, generates 3 value by blocking OR attacking all the same. The difference between attacking and blocking with it comes down to the fact that the interaction of: "Pitching a Blue card, consuming my Action Point and putting Raging Onslaught on the chain" produced 7 value. The **sources** of that value can be thought of as being 3 points of that value comes from your Blue, 1 comes from your Action Point, and 3 comes from the Raging Onslaught itself. In this way, Raging Onslaught was, indeed, worth 3 value.

I like doing this breakdown specifically because I found it simple enough and with an explanatory power that needs very little (if any) other "addendums" or exceptions in order to break down most situations.

This "Action Point" distinction is what, in my experience, gets a lot of people confused, and is a source of why people think that playing out a Raging Onslaught Red is worth more than blocking with it, when, in reality, as long as you have another card that "soaks in" your Action Point, it is the same rate (think Wounding Blow Red).

Just to continue to hammer the point in: imagine your hand is Raging Onslaught Red, a Blue card that blocks 3 and a Wounding Blow Red. You can get to a "10 value hand" if you need to block with 1 or 2 cards, but if you block with all 3 you only get 9 value, and that is, precisely, because you did not have something to spend your Action Point on.

Talking about hammers, think of Anothos. It's not a "1 card for 4". It's a Blue for 3 value and your Action Point for 1 value that makes it so Anothos HAS to attack for 4 to be on rate.

**Example C:** When you draw a Head Jab Red from the on-hit effect of a Snatch Red and arsenal it, the Snatch itself generated 6 points of value (1 comes from the Action Point, remember!).

Since the Head Jab you got was a direct result of Snatch hitting, it makes sense to "append" its value to the Snatch itself. If this same Snatch were to draw a Head Jab Blue instead, then you could say it generated 1 value off of its on hit effect.

The same can be said if it drew a Raging Onslaught Red, though. I like using Head Jab as an example because it is a simple example of "playing this card is worth 3 value." Think Nimblism, playing out an Overpower Red with Reprise active, and so on.

### On rate

**Definition 2:** A card is **on rate** if it indeed was used as 3 value by itself (remembering to deduce cost from the power of the attack and to deduce 1 from spending your Action Point, if it did so). A sequence of plays is "on rate" if each card used in that sequence was **on rate.**

As some additional quick examples to help illustrate these concepts:

* Critical Strike Red is worth 3. Although it attacks for 5, one of its value comes from the resource and the other from the Action Point it consumes, not the card itself.
* Surging Strike Red is worth 3. It costs one more than Critical Strike Red, but it also doesn't consume your Action Point, which is worth 1.
* A Howl from Beyond Red played from banish converts 2 resources into 3 value, something that is not too common. Any conversion above a 1-to-1 in terms of resources or Action Points is above rate.
* Giving *go again* to something is worth 1 value. This is derived from the fact that an Action Point is used by cards to provide 1 value.
* Blocking with a Sink Below Red is worth 4 value without using your Action Point. *Duh.* That's why Sink Below is so great.
* Activating Grasp of the Arknight for 2 resources is a 2-to-1 conversion from resources to value, as a Runechant is worth 1 value.
* Attacking with an active Rosetta Thorn is 2 above rate. This is because it uses one resource and one Action Point in order to produce 4 value.
* You pitched a Blue Card to attack with a Brutal Assault Red and passed. This play was *below* rate, because even though you got 3 Value out of your Brutal Assault and 1 from your Action Point, you used your Blue card as 2 value only. In other words, you did not use every resource generated by your card with a 1-to-1 conversion rate.

As a last example, imagine a turn in which you go: Lead the Charge Red, pitch a Blue for Brutal Assault Red, Rosetta Thorn. This turn was a "3-card-10".

This is, by definition, **an on rate turn,** as you turned 3 cards and your action point into 10 value. However, we can see clear inefficiencies in Lead the Charge, which used a whole card as 1 value (generating an action point), meaning it was a -2 value interaction (you expect a card to be worth 3 and it was worth 1), while the Rosetta Thorn was 2 value above what is to be expected. This is why, in the aggregate, you were "on rate," even though Lead the Charge is a below rate card and Rosetta is above rate.


### Tempo

This one is tricky especially if people come from other more traditional TCGs. I see *so* many people using this term without describing it that it has become a personal pet peeve of mine. It's like a catch-all umbrella term for "something that's important even though I don't know exactly what it is."

Tempo is one of those things that people normally *define by example.* This is because there might not be a single definition of Tempo that encompasses everything a person likes to call Tempo. As you can see, I am a bit obsessed with compact defitions, which is why I will propose a definition for Tempo that might seem weird to most people, as they don't use that word to mean what I'll propose it should. However, I will then attempt to give my justification as to why I like my definition.

**Definition 3:** Tempo is a measure of value associated with a sequence of plays. A **Tempo Play** is a sequence of plays that require you to bet on an outcome, in which winning or losing such bet will reward you with more or less value than an alternative sequence of plays you had available at the point of decision.

What a mouthful. Let's unpack it by walking through some examples.

#### Tempo Example 1
Say you're playing Bravo and have a Command and Conquer, a Red Pummel and two Blues that block 3 with no Tunic and no arsenal. Your opponent is attacking you with a Raging Onslaught Red. Now, what is the best line of play?

There is a line of play in which you block with the CnC, a Blue and on your turn attack with an Anothos for 4 and arsenal the Pummel. That will be a line which makes 3 value out of every card used and saves the Pummel for later use.

Now, you could, instead, simply choose to take the 7 damage and present the opponent with a Command and Conquer Pummel, pitching your two Blues in the process. With this line, there are a few scenarios:

**(a)** You get a hit in. The opponent loses the arsenal and discards a card. If we value each card as 3, then this sequence of plays netted you **16 points of value.**

**(b)** You don't get a hit in but save the Pummel (say the opponent blocked for 10). You end up with the Pummel in arsenal and a Blue dead in hand. In this sequence of plays you netted **13 points of value.** To calculate this, note you effectively attacked for 10 and saved a Pummel in arsenal, which, since it is a card, should be valued at 3.

**(c)** You don't get a hit in and played the Pummel (say the opponent blocked for 6, you pummeled and they played a Reinforce the Line). You end up with no arsenal and threatened 10 damage, thus, this sequence of plays netted you **10 points of value.**

The decision to **not** do the play that you knew would net you 13 points of value (blocking for 6, Anothos for 4, arsenal the Pummel) and, instead, **atempt a bet** that might net you: 3, 0 or -3 more value was, then, a **Tempo Play.**

If you managed to "hit" your Tempo Play, then you would say you got 3 value from a Tempo Play. Or, in other words, you are 3 Tempo positive.

#### Tempo Example 2
Your hand is 3 Blues that block 3 and a Crippling Crush and you have a Seismic Surge on the field.

The best value this hand can generate in a deterministic fashion involves blocking with a Blue and Playing out the Crippling Crush by pitching the other 2 Blues.

When you choose to not block and, instead, pitch the third blue to make a Seismic Surge and activate Bravo's Dominate ability, you are doing a Tempo Play, as you might've used your whole Blue for a Seismic Surge creation if the opponent has a Sink Below in arsenal and one in hand, meaning your Dominate clause didn't affect their optimal line given a Crippling Crush.

In other words, they would've blocked the Crippling Crush like that either way, whether it had dominate or not, thus, you "robbed" yourself of blocking with 3 with that Blue you used for a Surge and the Dominate.

So, how much Tempo did you lose in that specific exchange? Well, assuming your Blue could've blocked for 3 on the opponent's turn, then you traded 3 value for a Seismic Surge worth of value, which can be 1 or 0 value by itself. Thus, you lost at least 2 points of value on that Tempo Play.

However, if the Crush effect on Crippling Crush *did* connect, then the opportunity cost was, still, blocking for 3, but you got 2 cards worth of value from the on hit *plus* the value of the Seismic Surge (which again can be 1 or 0 value by itself). Since the discard is random you might even get more than 6 value out of the deal, assuming the opponent is left with a card they can't play that turn cycle, for example. Thus, finally, you netted *at least* 3 value out of your Tempo Play.

#### Tempo Example 3
Your opponent is attacking you but you don't think they will get you into lethal range this turn, but instead get you down to 2.

With your 4 card hand you believe you can force them into lethal range by attacking for 12, potentially getting them to block with a 2 block card that would be better spent offensively on their turn.

You could, also, simply play "normally" (getting 3 value out of each of your cards on block instead of 2 value on play, for example) and have 14 points of value on the turn cycle (say, block for 6 with two cards and attack for 8).

If you go with the attacking for 12 line, you *might* get them to to lose value as they are **forced** to use their hand in a non-optimal way. In that case, the amount of Tempo you get would be equal to the difference between how much value they **could've** gotten if they did their best play minus how much value they **ended up getting** after being forced to do choose another line of play.

#### Tempo Example 4
The above example really doesn't need the clause that you are being attacked or are attacking for lethal to be a Tempo Play, and can, instead, be generalized to include any scenario in which you make your opponent do a **potentially non-optimal** line with their cards. The most common way to make this happen is with on hit effects. It just so happens that when you are being attacked for lethal, all cards have an *"on hit, ya die"* clause written on them.

Some on hit effects are a "mini form of betting." When you present your opponent with a decision point (to let it hit or not) in which they don't know the exact outcome (in terms of value) of their decision, then you are asking them to, potentially, have a line of play that might yield less value than another, thus being - by defition - a Tempo Play.

To elucidate this, when you attack with a Snatch and the opponent *doesn't* know if the card you'll draw will be worth more or less than the value he'd get by using a card to block the on hit versus to simply use that same card on their turn, then you can make your opponent (through no fault of their own as they don't have all the necessary information to judge the best decision at the time they declare blocks) make a non-optimal play, thus, gaining some Tempo value.

#### Tempo Example 5
Say your hand is a Blue card, a Command and Conquer and a Raging Onslaught. The opponent has an arsenal and you go into your turn with those 3 cards in hand.

What's the best line of play here? In other words, is 1 point of damage worth more or less than CnC's on hit effect right now?

This depends, again, on the opponent's hand and *their* optimal play line. If their best play line already involves blocking with 2 cards and going into their turn with 2 cards, then you **missed on a point of value** by attacking with the CnC instead of the Raging Onslaught. If their optimal line of play *doesn't* involve blocking with two cards, then you, effectively, gained Tempo value from that exchange. **Let's put some numbers to this to make it clearer.**

The opponent's hand is: 3 Head Jab Red and a Wounding Blow. Their arsenal is a Head Jab Red. *(don't call the judge just because they have 4 copies of Head Jab)*

Their optimal line involves blocking with 0 cards, playing all 4 Head Jabs and finishing with a Wounding Blow. Blocking with any card means their turn cycle will have less value than not blocking at all.

If you attack with a Raging Onslaught, assuming no threat of lethal damage, they should simply take it and unleash their fury into you.

If you attack with the Command and Conquer, against their current hand it reads "gain 3 points of value." Block it or not, the opponent will have 3 less points of value than they otherwise would in that turn cycle. Thus, in that scenario, attacking with the CnC is 2 value better than attacking with the Raging Onslaught.

That all being said, you do not possess a non-probabilistic answer to the question "What's the best line of play?" at the time you have to make the decision, in which case you are making a Tempo Play by attacking with the CnC, as it can yield more or less value depending on unknown variables.

#### Tempo Example 6
Say you are playing against a Bravo that has an Anothos. You are using every card in your hand every turn for 3 value, plus your action point, but the Bravo is defending it all with 13 value of block (with a Sink Below for example), so you're leaking no damage for multiple turns.

The Bravo *could've* used one of their 3 blocks for pitch in order to unlock the value of their Action Point every turn by attacking with the Anothos, making 14 value out of their hand, but he doesn't, choosing to full block and give up on 1 point of value every turn.

The moment you draw up a hand and literally can't use a card for 3 value on block and have to, instead, use it as 2 value on pitch or play, you are "giving back" value to your opponent. Now one of the turns in which they didn't spend their AP (Action Point) was negated as you also did 1 less value than your optimal line which involved blocking.

If you do that repeatedly, you will be back to parity. Yes, you built up a value advantage since they had to go -1 value than their optimal line could every single turn, but you are *slowly* giving up on that Tempo exchange.

**This happens over multiple turns.** Now let's say you draw up a hand that can, literally, at most generate 7 value (say a hand with triple Raging Onslaught and a Blue) since the opponent is not attacking you. Now, you have to arsenal one of the Raging Onslaughts and effectively use the third one as a zero value card. This just gave your opponent 3 value back.

This explains why full block gameplans can work. They are giving up 1 AP value every single turn when they don't use it themselves, but you will give it back to them slowly over multiple turns as soon as you brick or have to go below vallue. It's as if the opponent is saying "I won't get maximum value, but neither will you."

This becomes a "problem" for you because decks are finite. Now, most of the time, that's not an issue because when you attack with a Raging Onslaught you are asking for 2 cards from your opponent while only losing one yourself, and, in the long run, the opponent might've given up so much AP value that you can just take it slow, give some Tempo back for them to smack you and unlock your 3 value per card by blocking some, or, if they're simply too far behind, take it on the face and threaten lethal by using a card for 2 value anyways on your turn, but threatening lethal so that they have to use a 3 block card for 2 value too, doing so repeatedly until they die.

Fatigue is a complex thing in Flesh and Blood, and much more can be written about it, but hopefully this example gives a framework as to how full fatigue by deck works, and how a fatigue by damage deck also works.

#### Tempo Example 7
Some cards are, inherently, cards that require you to bet on an outcome. In fact, most plays in FaB are like that: you don't know the precise outcome (in terms of value generated) at the time of play. That **doesn't** mean that most plays are Tempo plays.

Remember: to be a Tempo play, **there has to be a play that generates more value than possible outcomes of an alternative** (even in a probabilistic measure) for it to be considered a Tempo Play. If you're simply taking damage to do a play that generates more value than blocking (after valuing the on hits and their value) on a 5 card hand, that's not a Tempo Play per se, it might be just the best line you can possibly take.

For example:
* If you are deciding between attacking with a Wounding Blow or a Snatch, attacking with the Snatch is **not** a Tempo decision, because the alternative play is not better than this play.
* If you are deciding between two arrows that both have an on hit with the same amount of value (even probabilistic), say Drill Shot versus Searing Shot, then that decision is not a Tempo Play.
* If you are using a card for 2 value instead of getting 3 value by blocking with it (like pitching or playing out a yellow often does) but you *didn't* get a chance to use it for 3 value on block, then that's not a Tempo Play. You're simply doing the best you can with your cards.


Hopefully all these examples made sense to you and by now you are at least convinced it might make sense to define Tempo like so. I **really** encourage everyone to put this definition to challenge so we can better adapt it to be a meaningful term that can be used in FAB. I believe this defition has a lot of meaning behind it and still encompasses the spirit of what it means to lose or gain Tempo, while it also opens up space for other terms to be used as support to this definition such as **betting and pivoting.**


# REFACTOR WHATEVER ELSE IS BELOW, THIS IS NOT GOOD



I'll argue there is no *inherent* advantage in Flesh and Blood to having Tempo. In fact, I'd argue that even in MtG there is none. Let me quickly detour into MtG. If you haven't played it, you may skip the next two paragraphs.

    **#REMOVE THIS LATER**
    When you Counterspell an opponent's play that cost 10, you didn't necessarily, gain an advantage from that. You traded 1-for-1 in terms of card and you traded up 2-to-10 in terms of resources. **But,** if you *don't* have a way to take advantage of this interaction (say you didn't use your other 8 mana on that turn cycle), then you simply didn't get an advantage in the first place. If you get an advantage from that Counterspell it's because you managed to use the remaining resources to accomplish something else, otherwise you simply traded a card of yours for a card of theirs.

    As another example, when you Remand a 10 mana spell, your opponent invested their whole turn into something, ending up with all their mana spent, and you started your turn with the same amount of cards as you previosly had. People call that a Tempo play and I agree. **However,** if you simply pass on your turn again (accomplishing nothing else except drawing a card on your draw step) and your opponent simply plays that same card again, then, well, nothing changed, as they also drew an extra card on their turn and we're back to the same scenario as before. Thus having Tempo didn't net you any advantage by itself.
    **#REMOVE THIS LATER**

    In MtG, Tempo is, often, a shortcut to say "whoever benefits from the game staying as it is right now." Yes, this is extremely hard to answer in a game like MtG, which is why there are other proxies/meanings for Tempo such as spending less resources on removal gives you Tempo, chump blocking loses Tempo, etc. I just Escaped an Uro and you had to spend a card to kill it, and on the next turn I Escape Uro again. Who benefits from the game staying as it is?

    Thus, I believe Tempo is tied with the absolute classic "Who's the Beatdown?" question. You might often be inefficient in your card exchanges in order to preserve your board. Why, though? Because having a board lets you try to push for lethal, afterall, you don't get a reward for winning with 10 cards in hand. If you can use every single card in your hand in order to get a win, you do it. You want to use your resources in order to, continually, be the player benefitting from the *status quo.*

Now let's go back to FAB.

It is **much** easier in FAB to determine which player benefits from the *status quo* than it is in MtG, as there aren't many effects that linger on for more than a turn, making each turn cycle isolated from the last one, for the most part. When Alice has 15 more health than Bob and Bob goes into his turn and swings Anothos for 4, you know Alice is winning.

Of course there are other considerations to decide that such as remaining threat density in matches that might go the long run, pitch stacking, board presence, combo potential in the case of Kano and many other stuff, I'm sure. But the point still stands: if you could accurately account for it, you could more easily know who's ahead.




People tend to also describe a Tempo play with an example like so:

Alice is being attacked and can profitably block and play the remaining cards on her turn, being [On Rate][#on-rate] in the process. However, Alice chooses to have a lower value play (meaning it is now below rate) in order to go to her turn with more cards and threaten lethal. **In this case, we would say Alice did a Tempo play.**

I think describing the above scenario as saying Alice did a Tempo play does, indeed, make sense. However, I believe it would be better explained through another lens.

I would say, in this same example, Alice is simply trying to get value back through other means. Alice is "gambling", or - as I prefer - **betting** that this apparent lower value play will pay itself in the future. This can be through presenting lethal, and, thus, forcing the opponent into not using their cards in the way they wanted it to (think blocking with a Scar for a Scar Red instead of playing it).

This also works in the case where Alice isn't threatening lethal necessarily, but is instead hoping the opponent doesn't have the exact card that punishes their bet. For example, if Alice is playing Tear Asunder into Anothos for 7 hoping the opponent doesn't have a Sink Below in arsenal (as that would mean Alice did a 3-card-7 value play since she didn't get the on hit effect).

Even more, Alice might simply want to get the opponent's equipment block now in order to, later, threaten even more punishing on hits when the opponent has no armor, again getting the value back on the "lower value play" she made in the past.

I think **betting** does way more justice to explain Alice's decisions than simply saying "she did a Tempo play." Alice's thought process here is clear: she is doing a play such that, if it pays out, then she will end up with more value than the apparent "higher value play." But that is simply Alice betting on the future of the game: she is doing a play that *can* yield more value.

This is because, when assigning value to a sequence of plays, we **might not know** how much value we get until it all gets resolved. When you Pummel your attack, if you do get the on hit, then Pummel was a 5 value card (2 damage from the resources it cost plus 2 damage from the card itself, plus got a card from the opponent's hand which is generally worth 3). This is the case with more than just Pummel; that is, it is not uncommon to have cards that are below rate in a scenario and above rate in another. As examples of this:

* Soulbead Strike is a 4 value card by itself if it hits, and a Wounding Blow if it doesn't.
* Razor Reflex is a 2 value card by itself if it doesn't hit, and a 4 value card if it does.
* Snatch has an on hit that can draw a 3 value card (red cards) or a 1 value card (a blue that can't be pitched).
* Dominate Crippling Crush used 2 resources in order to dominate it, and if its Crush gets covered by a Defense Reaction in arsenal, then you invested 2 resources for no gain at all. If it does Crush, however, you get 6 or more points of value from making the opponent discard 2 random cards.
* When you play Art of War choosing to banish and draw 2 and you don't hit what you expected to (say you draw 2 blues instead of 2 reds and have to just swing for 4 and pass), then you were betting to hit 2 reds (or a red and a blue) and your fail-case was being inefficient by some amount of value in which you just could've just blocked with your cards and swung your weapon.
  
Okay. Hopefully you see why we should include betting in our vocabulary. Now I'll define it and go back to Tempo and why I think that my definition is useful.

**Definition 4:** Betting is when you have a play or sequence of plays that yields some value *X* and, instead, choose to make another sequence of plays that can yield more or less than *X,* depending on variables that are not controllable or known to you at the decision making point.

If you're smart, then you're realizing we offloaded some of the **sentiment** of what it means to have Tempo to the word Betting. I personally think this new term is better at conveying the decision process that makes a player do an *apparently* worse play. And I also think this applies to MtG, but in FAB it is much easier to see the impacts and payoffs of your bets directly, while in MtG there is just so much going on and things have compounding effects that range way beyond in FAB, which is why I think the word Tempo can be okay there... The impact of a decision is just more wishy-washy and murky over there.

Finally, onto the defition of Tempo I gave in the start of this section. This new term is useful to convey a few other sentiments. First off, it conveys the idea that Tempo by itself is not an advantage. So what the Bravo has 5 cards at the start of their turn if his hand is full of blues. He had the Tempo, and it doesn't matter.

That being said, some heroes do indeed like to play with Tempo. This is because **hands have an optimal Tempo they want to be played at.** If your hand is 3 Scar for a Scar and 1 Snatch, then you want to play at a Tempo of 4. You don't want to block at all, as that means you are getting a lower value than playing those cards out.
